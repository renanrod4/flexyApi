# What should be included when creating API documentation?
    Every API is different and therefore requires documentation that is tailor-made for its consumers. Nevertheless, the following components can serve as an initial checklist for creating high-quality API documentation:

# Authentication instructions
    Authentication helps keep an API's data safe and secure, and it is the first hurdle that a developer must cross when using a new API. If an API's authentication process is too difficult or poorly documented, the developer might become frustrated and decide to try a different API. API documentation must therefore include a clear explanation of the available authentication methods and provide thorough, step-by-step instructions for obtaining and using authentication credentials.

# Detailed information about every endpoint, operation, and resource
    API documentation should offer a comprehensive overview of every API endpoint and operation, including parameters, headers, and request and response bodies. It should also thoroughly explain the relevant data models, including their required attributes and any default, minimum, and maximum values. These details help ensure full coverage of every possible use case and empower consumers to construct complex requests that might otherwise be prone to errors.

# Examples of common requests and responses
    Examples are a crucial part of effective API documentation, as they help consumers understand endpoint behavior under a variety of conditions. Producers should include example requests in several client languages, as well as example responses, which enable consumers to troubleshoot issues they might encounter. Examples can also be used to guide new users through a sequence of API calls that are involved in a specific workflow, which provides important insight into how an API can support sophisticated use cases.

# Terms of Use 
    Public API documentation should include a Terms of Use, which is a legal agreement that helps producers ensure their API's data and functionality is not abused by consumers. It should also include information on the API's rate limits, which dictate how many API calls a consumer can make in a given period of time. Rate limits help protect an API from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, as well as any other activity that may negatively affect its performance. Consumers who exceed their rate limit will be temporarily unable to execute any additional calls, which may lead to user-facing downtime.
